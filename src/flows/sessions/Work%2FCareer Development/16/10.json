These don't have to only be feelings that you've had in the past or negative feelings that you assume you'd have in the moment. Think creatively about both positive and negative feelings that may come up for you in reaction to the situation. If you write a negative feeling, try to also write how you might cope with that feeling. \n\nOn the next page, take 30 seconds to write as many different feelings that you could imagine having in this situation. You can be as creative as you want. If you write any negative feelings (like scared or anxious), try to also write how you could help yourself feel better in the moment.\n\nPress return after each feeling to write a new one on each line."
