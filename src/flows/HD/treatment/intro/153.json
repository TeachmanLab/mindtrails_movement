When you complete sessions in the app, you will be asked to read brief stories about situations that often produce anxiety and fill in missing letters to complete words, fill in entire words, or come up with new stories that are personally relevant to you. To help familiarize you with the program and help you get the most out of this experience, we would like you complete a few short exercises and watch some brief videos explaining how MindTrails Movement works. You will also be presented with three example stories so that you can begin to get the hang of the training. Click next to get started!"
