You'll first be asked to complete some surveys about your mental health and thinking patterns. Then, we'll give you some more information about the rationale for this program and explain how to get the most out of the app. You'll have the opportunity to set up a meeting with the research team at the end of this session if you have any questions or concerns. Ready to get started? Hit the Next button below to begin filling out questionnaires."
